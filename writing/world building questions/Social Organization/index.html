<p>Worldbuilding Questions: Social Organization
- General
    - Where is scientific and/or magical research done — universities, private labs, under the auspices of the ruler/government, etc.?
    - Does it require a license to be a wizard? 
    - If so, is it more like a driver’s license (something nearly everyone in our culture gets upon coming of age) or like a doctor’s license (something only a small percentage of the population will ever get)? 
    - Who certifies wizards: government, wizard’s guild/AMA, local priests?
    - What are the various ranks and titles and proper forms of address for the aristocracy/nobility? 
    - Is everybody “my lord” and “my lady,” or are there more distinctions (your grace, your highness, your majesty, your holiness)?
    - What occupations are respected? 
    - Looked down on? 
    - Why?
    - How many levels are there in this society: peasant, bourgeoisie, warrior, noble? 
    - How difficult is it to rise or fall from one social level to another? 
    - How firm are the divisions between social classes — is it disgraceful for a noble to engage in trade or for a warrior to help with the harvest?
    - How difficult is it to rise or fall from one social level to another? 
    - How much social mobility is there? 
    - How much do people think there is?
    - What are the standards of beauty for people? 
    - Paintings and sculpture? 
    - Clothes and furniture? 
    - How do they differ from the standards in your culture (example: a country which considers fatness a highly desirable beauty trait)? How do standard of beauty reflect the physical traits of the various races (examples: dwarves might consider excessive height unattractive; werewolves might be attracted by long teeth or a particular scent)?
- Government
    - How has the presence of magic and magicians affected law and government? 
    - Are wizards barred from certain kinds of government jobs or offices? 
    - Do some government jobs require that their holder be a wizard?
    - What is the basic style of government: feudal, aristocratic, oligarchy, absolute ruler, democracy, what? 
    - What forms are used in neighboring countries, and why are they the same or different?
    - What services does the government or head of state provide: schools, wells, courts, an army to protect people from the Vikings? 
    - What services are provided locally or privately?
    - Who has the right to levy taxes? 
    - For what? 
    - On what or whom? 
    - Can taxes be paid in kind, or do certain things require money?
    - Who provides support services for the head of state? 
    - What are they called: King’s Counselors, Cabinet Ministers, Secretary of State, Good Ol’ Girls? 
    - Are they hereditary offices, civil servants, appointees, military, elected?
    - Is the relative power of a country or ruler usually measured by the size of its army, the number and ability of its wizards, or the amount of money/trade flowing through it?
    - Who is considered a citizen, with the rights and privileges thereof? 
    - What are those rights and privileges (voting, protection from thieves, the right to a hearing in Rome) and what responsibilities go along with them (jury duty, providing funds or knights for the lord’s army?
    - Are there certain classes of people (wizards, foreigners, children, peasants, women) who have fewer legal rights or less recourse than full citizens? 
    - Why? 
    - Are they considered mentally or morally deficient, a danger to the state, or is there some other rationale?
    - What are the easiest/most common ways to advance in status — amass more money, marry well, get the ruler’s eye, etc.? 
    - How much resistance is there to someone advancing in social status?
    - Who will take over running the government if the current head of state is incapacitated? 
    - How is this determined? 
    - Is there an heir apparent (either actual or political)? 
    - What happens if the heir is a minor? 
    - Who gives orders? 
    - How are they picked?
    - Who is responsible for protecting the head of state? 
    - His personal guard, the Secret Service, an elite group affiliated with the regular military? 
    - What safeguards have they got against assassins, poisoning, direct assault, magical attack?
    - Who can give orders (to military, to tax collectors, to servants, to ordinary folks on the street)? 
    - How are such people chosen?
    - Who is responsible for coinage: the ruler, local barons, someone else (merchant guilds)? 
    - Are there generally acceptable standards? 
    - How easy/common is counterfeiting?
    - Is there an organized system of education? 
    - If so, who provides it: government, churches, private persons? 
    - How is it supported?
    - Who can call up men for an army, and how? 
    - Does the ruler ask the nobility for men, who in turn draft their peasants, or can the ruler go straight to the bottom?
    - How much formal spying and intelligence gathering is normally done by governments? 
    - The military? 
    - Merchant guilds and wealthy tradesmen? 
    - Are there actual organizations, or is spying done by diplomats and/or freelance agents? 
    - How effective is it currently?
    - Do relations between countries depend mainly on the relations between the heads of state, or can two rulers hate each other’s guts without being able to just declare war and drag their countries into it?
    - Are there times when people are expected to fast, or feast (e.g., before solstice, after the birth of a child, during Lent or Ramadan, after the death of a ruler, etc.)? 
    - Are there occasions when the ruler is expected to provide a celebration or spectacle for the people to enjoy, (e.g., the Roman gladiatorial games)?
- Politics
    - Is magic a profession, an art, or just a job? 
    - What is the status accorded to magicians in this society? 
    - Are they forbidden overt political action, or are wizards and the wizard’s guild knee-deep in court intrigue?
    - Are magicians a force in politics, or are they above it? 
    - Are there national politics that revolve around magic/wizards (i.e., trying to outlaw, protect, or promote certain kinds of magic, trying to draft wizards into a ruler’s army, licensing of magicians, etc.)? 
    - Do wizards have a lobby? 
    - Do they need one?
    - Is there tension, rivalry, or outright hostility between any of the actual gods? 
    - How does this affect church politics? 
    - People’s everyday lives?
    - Does the level of technological advancement match the level of social and political advancement?
    - Is the relative power of a country or ruler usually measured by the size of its army, the number and ability of its wizards, or the amount of money/trade flowing through it?
    - What are the easiest/most common ways to advance in status — amass more money, marry well, get the ruler’s eye, etc.? 
    - How much resistance is there to someone advancing in social status?
    - What are the major political factions at present? 
    - How long have they been around? 
    - Which factions are allies, which enemies? 
    - Are there any potential new forces on the political scene (e.g., a rising middle class, a university gaining unexpected power because of certain magical discoveries, etc.)
    - What are the controversial political issues of this day/time/country?
