<p>Worldbuilding Questions: Commerce, Trade, and Public Life
- General
    - Which peoples/countries/races fought, allied, traded, or were traditional rivals? 
    - Where are there still hard feelings about old events?
    - Is there a “trade language” that facilitates commerce between countries that don’t speak the same tongue? 
    - Is there a “universal language” spoken by educated or noble persons, as Latin was in the Middle Ages?
    - What does this country import? 
    - Export?
    - How important is trade to the economy? 
    - How is currency exchange handled, and by whom?
    - Why did people settle in this country in the first place — strategic location, trade route, water transport, minerals, good farming, etc.?
    - Have things changed much since, or do they still depend on whatever brought them in the first place?
    - How much do official attitudes toward other countries affect commerce and trade? 
    - Do merchants pretty much ignore tensions between government as long as they can make a profit, or will this get them into trouble? 
    - Are there Customs inspectors or their equivalents at border crossings? 
    - Is the export/import of some technologies/magics/commodities regulated by the government, or by non-governmental cartels? 
    - How does this affect political relationships between countries?
- Business and Industry
    - How is business organized? 
    - Are there trade unions? 
    - Guild structures? 
    - Multi-state corporations? 
    - International cartels?
    - Are people able to cross-craft, I.e., learn or perform different trades? 
    - Does cross-crafting require guild permission, a write from an overlord, or is it automatically guaranteed by law? 
    - How strict are craft restrictions — are carpenters the only people allowed to build houses?
    - What types of trades would be represented in a small town? 
    - A middle-sized town? 
    - A large city?
    - Is currency and coinage standardized, or is there a system of exchange? 
    - What are typical denominations? 
    - What types of currency is a traveler or merchant likely to carry on a trip? 
    - What are different coins called, and what are they worth?
    - Are industrial processes (e.g., swordmaking, weaving, etc.) considered “trade secrets,” or are they common knowledge?
    - What is the process a young person goes through to enter a craft or trade? 
    - An apprenticeship? 
    - Four years of college? 
    - Are the craft requirements for various skill ranks (such as apprentice, journeyman, master, or med student, intern, doctor, specialist) standardized, or does rank depend more on the good favor of a master craftsman than it does on skill?
    - Do different regions/cities specialize in specific crafts, processes, or products (examples: Damascus steel, Bordeaux wines, Chinese silk, Wisconsin cheese)? 
    - Do different races specialize?
    - What regulations, if any, has the government/ruler placed on business practices? 
    - Are there antimonopoly laws? 
    - Anti-pollution? 
    - Are there standardized systems of weights and measures, or does a merchant have to specify “a London bushel” of grain rather than “a York bushel”? 
    - How do differing systems affect shipping and trade?
    - Are any new industries developing?

    - Where do they fit in society? 
    - Are there trading guilds? 
    - If so, how are they organized? 
    - How much power do they have to control trade? 
    - How much infighting is there among them?
    - Are there trading organizations that transcend countries (like the Hanseatic League)? 
    - How large a presence do they have locally?
    - Is this a money-based economy, or mostly barter?
    - What goods are commonly available in small town markets? 
    - In large towns? 
    - In cities? 
    - How do goods get to market?
    - What industries — mining, fishing, shipbuilding, lumber, farming, manufacturing, etc. — are important, and in which areas? 
    - Which depend on materials from other areas (as shipbuilding on wood, or weaving on wool)? 
    - What happens if supplies are disrupted?
    - Who is responsible for coinage: the ruler, local barons, someone else (merchant guilds)? 
    - Are there generally acceptable standards? 
    - How easy/common is counterfeiting?
    - How much smuggling is there? 
    - Of what, from or to where?
- Transportation and Communication
    - What are the common domesticated animals used for transportation at various levels of society — e.g., oxen, horses, donkeys, camels, etc.?
    - Are there magical means of transportation (teleport spells, magic carpets, dragon-riding)? 
    - How do they compare in speed, safety and expense to non-magical means? 
    - Are there any drawbacks to magical travel (for example, teleport sickness)? 
    - How commonly are they used, and for what purposes (industrial shipping vs. travel for fun)?
    - For traveling short distances within a city, what are the alternatives? 
    - Can people hire a cab, a litter, a rickshaw, or do they have to walk or rely on their own servants or horses?

    - How large a group is considered safe? 
    - How much traffic is there inside and outside the main cities? 
    - Which areas are best/worst?
    - What is the fastest means of traveling long distances over land? 
    - Over water? 
    - Which methods are safest?
    - What is transportation like? 
    - Are there good roads? 
    - Who built them? 
    - Who is responsible for maintaining them?
    - Where would a traveler stay at night? 
    - Are there enough travelers to support inns, or do people have to stay at some equivalent of medieval monasteries?
    - Are some classes of people (slaves, peasants) not expected to travel at all? 
    - Are some (heralds, messengers) expected to travel constantly?
    - How do people find out what is happening in the world — rumor, town crier, newspapers, TV and radio? 
    - How slanted is the news they get this way, and in what direction? 
    - Is there freedom of the press? 
    - If not, who controls/censors it and by what means?
    - How are books produced? 
    - Are they common (has the printing press been invented) or are they rare, valuable, expensive, hand-written objects? 
    - If the latter, who has the time and skill to produce them?
    - Where are the great libraries or collections of books/scrolls/manuscripts?
