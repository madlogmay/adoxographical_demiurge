    - Are they different for men and women? 
    - For nobility and peasants?
    - What customs surround a birth and the introduction of a new child to the family? 
    - Is the mother sequestered for some period? 
    - Is the child? 
    - Is there a formal presentation of the new child to parents, grandparents, overlord, priest? 
    - Is a feast and celebration declared, or does everyone keep a low profile to keep from attracting demons or bad luck?
    - Who is normally present for births?

    - Do they dress differently from adults? 
    - If so, when do they change to adult dress?
    - What customs surround death and burial? 
    - Is there a special class of people (doctors, priests, funeral directors, untouchables) who deal with dead bodies? 
    - What things must be done and why (burn hair to free spirit, burn body to prevent necromancy, coins on eyes for ferryman, etc.)? 
    - Are the dead feared, revered, or ignored?
    - What personal weapons are available to anyone who can afford them? 
    - Are some considered “for nobles only” either by custom or by law? 
    - Are there laws forbidding certain classes from being armed at all?
- Eating
    - Do men and women, parents and children, servants and master, eat separately, or does everyone eat together? 
    - How is status displayed at the table (seating above or below the salt, near or far from the head, etc.)?
    - What dishes are considered holiday food? 
    - What foods/drinks are associated with particular holidays, events (e.g., funerals, weddings) or times of the year?

    - How do high-court manners differ from everyday ones?
    - What eating utensils are used, if any? 
    - Forks, eating knife, spoons, chopsticks?
    - What is the order of a typical upper-class meal — do they start with wine, then a sweet, then a stew, then a salad, or do they bring everything in at once?
    - Are special arrangements necessary for entertaining guests of different races/species — taller chairs for dwarves, raw meat for werewolves, perches for harpies, etc.? 
    - How do the eating customs of different races reflect their cultures and biology? 
    - How difficult does this make social interaction among the races?
    - Is sanitation good enough for untreated water to be safe to drink?

    - What types of food or seasoning are characteristic of different races? 
    - Different cultures? 
    - Different countries?
- Greeting and Meeting
    - When meeting someone, how are they greeted — wave, handshake, bow, some other gesture? 
    - How did the greeting gesture originate (example: shaking hands to prove one’s weapon hand was empty)? 
    - Is there a special I-am-not-armed gesture for wizards?
    - Is there a difference between the greeting offered to an equal and that offered to a superior or inferior? 
    - Is there a difference between the greeting offered a man or a woman? 
    - Human/non-human?
    - Is there a way of changing a greeting gesture to make it insulting?
    - How are two people who have never met normally introduced to each other? 
    - What is the order of precedence when there are several people of differing sex or social status present, all of whom need to be introduced to each other?
    - Are there classes of people/beings who are never introduced to other classes of people/beings? 
    - Are “true names” significant, and if so, under what circumstances would someone be given another person/being’s true name?
    - Are there customs involving the way in which someone is named when being introduced (for example: giving all of a person’s names and titles at the first meeting, but never repeating them afterward, so that he’s always referred to as “George” even though he’s introduced as the Duke George Edward Canterbury Gorden de la Suis-Foule, Marquis of Horsham, Whitewater and Framingham, Earl of St. Peter’s Close, and Vicount of Abernathy)?
    - Is there any difference in the way you greet someone you already know, compared to greeting a stranger (or does everybody just always hug or shake hands or whatever)? 
    - How does someone acknowledge seeing an acquaintance at a distance (passing on the other side of the street) — by a nod, tipping the hat, wave, smile, or not at all?
- Gestures
    - When meeting someone, how are they greeted — wave, handshake, bow, some other gesture? 
    - How did the greeting gesture originate (example: shaking hands to prove one’s weapon hand was empty)?
    - Are gestures and body language in this society generally subtle or not? 
    - Do people talk with their hands, or is that considered vulgar?
    - Is there a way of changing a greeting gesture to make it insulting?
    - What is a comfortable and polite speaking distance for people in this culture? 
    - Other cultures/countries/races? 
    - How aware are people of these differences?
    - What gestures are insulting? 
    - What do they mean? 
    - Do some gestures differ in meaning depending on the culture, race, or time (example: the American “V”-for-victory sign, which became the peace sign, and which is/was highly insulting in Europe)?
    - How do gestures and body language differ between countries? 
    - Between species? 
    - Are there things that don’t matter in one area that are mortal insults in another (eating with the left hand, etc.)?
    - What are the ways of showing respect (bowing, saluting, etc.)? 
    - To whom is one expected to show such respect — one’s elders, superiors in rank, teachers, priests, etc.?
- Visits
    - Are there questions that must be asked or avoided (how’s the family, how’s the business, never talk politics or religion, etc.)?
