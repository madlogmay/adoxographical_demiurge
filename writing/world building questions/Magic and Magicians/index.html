<p>Worldbuilding Questions: Magic and Magicians
- Rules of Magic
    - What things can magic not do? 
    - What are the limits to magical power? 
    - How do magicians try to get around these limits?
    - What is the price magicians must pay in order to be magicians — years of study, permanent celibacy, using up bits of their life or memory with each spell, etc.? 
    - Does anyone ever try to get around the price of magic?
    - Is there a difference between miracles and magic? 
    - If so, how are they distinguished?
    - Where does magic power come from: the gods, the “mana” of the world, the personal willpower of the magician? 
    - Is magic an exhaustible resource? 
    - If a magician must feed his spells with his own willpower, life-force, or sanity, what long-term effects will this have on the health and/or stability of the magician? 
    - Do different races/species have different sources for their magic, or does everybody use the same one?
    - How does a magician tap his/her magic power? 
    - Does becoming a magician require some rite of passage (investing one’s power in an object, being chosen by the gods, constructing or being given a permanent link to the source of power) or does it just happen naturally, as a gradual result of much study or as a part of growing up?
    - What do you need to do to cast a spell — design an elaborate ritual, recite poetry, mix the right ingredients in a pot? 
    - Are there things like a staff, a wand, a familiar, a crystal ball, that are necessary to have before casting spells? 
    - If so, where and how do new wizards get these things? 
    - Do they make them, buy them from craftsmen, inherit them from their teachers, or order them from Wizardry Supplies, Inc.?
    - Is there a numerical limit to the number of wizards in the world? 
    - What is it? 
    - Why?
    - How long does it take to cast a spell? 
    - Can spells be stored for later, instant use? 
    - Does working spells take lots of long ritual, or is magic a “point and shoot” affair?
    - Can two or more wizards combine their power to cast a stronger spell, or is magic done only by individuals? 
    - What makes one wizard more powerful than another — knowledge of more spells, ability to handle greater levels of power, having a more powerful god as patron, etc.?
    - Does practicing magic have any detrimental effect on the magician (such as becoming addictive, fomenting insanity, or shortening life-span)? 
    - If so, is there any way to prevent these effects? 
    - Are the effects inevitable to all magicians, or do they affect only those with some sort of predisposition? 
    - Do they progress at the same rate in everyone? 
    - Are they universal in all species, or are some races (dwarves, elves, whoever) immune to these detrimental effects?
    - How much is known about the laws of nature, physics, and magic? 
    - How much of what is commonly known is wrong (e.g., Aristotle’s ideas about human anatomy, which were wrong but accepted for centuries)?
    - What general varieties of magic are practiced (e.g., herbal potions, ritual magic, alchemical magic, demonology, necromancy, etc.)? 
    - Do any work better than others, or does only one variety actually work?
    - Are certain kinds of magic practiced solely or chiefly by one sex or the other? 
    - By one race or another? 
    - Is this because of inborn ability, natural preferences, or legislation?
    - Does a magician’s magical ability or power change over time — e.g., growing stronger or weaker during puberty, or with increasing age? 
    - Can a magician “use up” all of his/her magic, thus ceasing to be a magician? 
    - If this happens, what does the ex-magician do — die, retire, take up teaching, go into a second career, start a freelance consulting business?
    - Can the ability to do magic be lost? 
    - If so, how — overdoing it, “burning out,” brain damage due to fever or a blow, etc.?
    - Can the ability to work magic be taken away? 
    - If so, how and by whom? (Traditional example: certain spells that can only be worked by virgins; raping such a witch robbed her of her powers.)
- Wizards
    - Does practicing magic have any detrimental effect on the magician (such as becoming addictive, fomenting insanity, or shortening life-span)? 
    - If so, is there any way to prevent these effects? 
    - Are the effects inevitable to all magicians, or do they affect only those with some sort of predisposition? 
    - Do they progress at the same rate in everyone? 
    - Are they universal in all species, or are some races (dwarves, elves, whoever) immune to these detrimental effects?
    - What is the price magicians must pay in order to be magicians — years of study, permanent celibacy, using up bits of their life or memory with each spell, etc.? 
    - Does anyone ever try to get around the price of magic?
    - How do various religions,if any, view magic? 
    - Do any forbid it? 
    - Why or why not? 
    - Do any require priests/priestesses to be magicians? 
    - Do any forbid magicians from holding some or all religious offices?
    - How long does it take to learn magic?
    - Is magic a profession, an art, or just a job? 
    - What is the status accorded to magicians in this society? 
    - Are they the equivalent of shyster lawyers, politicians, and used car salesmen, or are they considered average working stiffs, or are they looked up to and admired?
    - Are wizards organized? 
    - How? 
    - What hierarchy, if any, do they recognize? 
    - What happens if the person/people at the top get killed? 
    - Who takes over? 
    - How soon?
    - Can anyone become a wizard, or does one need to be born with some special talent or gift?
    - Are different races/intelligent species good at different types of magic? 
    - If so, what types are associated with what races/species? 
    - Are there species that use magic more or less unconsciously — for instance, dragons using magic to fly without being consciously aware of it, or werewolves using magic to change?
    - Can you make a living practicing magic, or do you have to have independent means? 
    - If you can make a living, what are you doing — making magic swords, or making it rain for local farmers? 
    - What’s a wizard’s job market like? 
    - What’s a wizard’s average income, relative to the rest of society?
    - Are magicians a force in politics, or are they above it? \
    - Are there national politics that revolve around magic/wizards (i.e., trying to outlaw, protect, or promote certain kinds of magic, trying to draft wizards into a ruler’s army, licensing of magicians, etc.)? 
    - Do wizards have a lobby? 
    - Do they need one?
    - Does it require a license to be a wizard? 
    - If so, is it more like a driver’s license (something nearly everyone in our culture gets upon coming of age) or like a doctor’s license (something only a small percentage of the population will ever get)? 
    - Who certifies wizards: government, wizard’s guild/AMA, local priests?
    - How do local people view wizards?
